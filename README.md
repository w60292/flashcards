# Flashcards

This side project is for my daughter who is a three grade student, I'd like to help her to learn English vocabulary more efficiently. As I know, using flashcards frequently would be helpful for memorizing vocabulary. Hence, I'll not only provide the flashcard features online and but also print them out as physical flashcards. Enjoy it!

## Features For Now!

- List vocabulary.
- Display flashcards and read out three times.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
